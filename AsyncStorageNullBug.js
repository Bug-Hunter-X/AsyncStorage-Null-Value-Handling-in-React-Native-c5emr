This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native, specifically when you try to access a value that doesn't exist.  It doesn't throw a standard error, but rather returns `null`, leading to unexpected behavior in your application.  The problem is that applications often don't explicitly handle the `null` return, leading to crashes or silent failures.
