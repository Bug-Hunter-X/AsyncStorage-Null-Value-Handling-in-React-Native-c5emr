# AsyncStorage Null Value Handling in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue in React Native applications using AsyncStorage.  When attempting to retrieve a value from AsyncStorage that doesn't exist, AsyncStorage silently returns `null`. This can lead to unexpected application behavior if not properly handled.

The `AsyncStorageNullBug.js` file illustrates the problem.  The `AsyncStorageNullSolution.js` demonstrates a robust solution to prevent crashes or silent failures.

## Bug Description

The issue stems from the lack of explicit error handling when dealing with missing keys in AsyncStorage.  Traditional error-handling mechanisms do not trigger, making debugging difficult. The solution involves adding explicit checks for `null` values and handling them appropriately, typically with a default value or alternative logic.
